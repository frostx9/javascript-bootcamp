## How Code Execuation Work

*1 Parsing Step*:  When We Write code in a js file the before execuation we do some parsing. It means the engine collect the all 
special key word, lile let, cosnt, log, for etc.. and create a syntax tree.

*2. Jit Compiler (Just In Time Comipler)* : In this step the engine convert the syntax tree into a Byte code. Then this byte code will be
converted into machine code.

*3. Execuation Phase* : This is the phase where the machine code will be executed.
