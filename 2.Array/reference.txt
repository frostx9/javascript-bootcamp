when we create varaible to store something , we creating value type varaible.
It means javascript store all of the varaible. Only with premitve data type

But large thing like array, it doest not store all of those value in varaible itself
it store a reference of the array. reference is a kind of a memory address. It means
when we create a array with varaible , this varaible store only memory reference(address) , where
the array is in memory



const person = []

person.name = "White"

consoel.log(person) -> Ans. [name : "White"]

in here array person convert to object

** Array is a kind of object but not fundamentally

Shallow Copy - Share The memory reference

Deep Copy - Did Not Share The memory reference
